DCSocial is an experimental decentralized social dApp, built as a sandbox to test concepts for the **Decentralized Credit Protocol (DCP)**.  

The project explores:
- **Frontend**: modern web client for user interactions.  
- **Backend**: API and service layer for data, auth, and logic.  
- **Integration**: testing flows for credit, trust, and ethical interaction models.
