DCSocial ‚Äì Decentralized Creator Social Platform

DCSocial is a next-generation social networking dApp designed for creators, leaders, and their communities.
It enables a decentralized attention economy, where influence and engagement are measurable, tradeable, and directly beneficial to those who generate value.

Our mission: Own your audience. Save your audience. Build with them.

üöÄ Vision

Traditional platforms monetize creators‚Äô audiences without transparency or shared benefits.
DCSocial flips this model by giving creators and communities the ability to:

Own their audience: direct, verifiable connections with no intermediaries.

Protect their audience: safeguard against spam, low-quality feeds, and algorithmic manipulation.

Build sustainable growth: leverage decentralized scoring and referral mechanics to grow influence and monetize attention ethically.

üîë Key Features

Decentralized Feed Scoring (DFS)
A transparent algorithm that ranks posts using:

Referral weight (direct connections prioritized).

Engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, comments).

Ethical credit score (trustworthiness & positive contributions).

Time decay (freshness of content).

Referral-Based Growth Engine
Creators invite their audience through unique referral links. Audiences who join are directly connected to their referrer, creating multi-level, non-exploitative referral networks.

Gamified Reputation System

Badges (Founder, Rescued, Top Influencer).

Missions for community growth.

Credit staking to boost content visibility.

Community-First Communication

Group chats with threat-mode protection: max 20 messages/minute, high-score messages prioritized.

Signal-to-noise optimization for meaningful conversations.

Impact Dashboard for Leaders

Track F1/F2/F3 referral growth.

Average audience credit score.

Post performance analytics.

Referral chain visualization.

üèó System Architecture

Frontend: Next.js + Telegram WebApp integration, PWA for mobile install.

Backend: Modular API with pluggable scoring algorithms.

Database: Flexible (Firebase or MongoDB for MVP, scalable to decentralized storage in production).

Config Layer: Unified config for FE/BE to ensure consistent scoring and logic.

üìä FeedScore Formula

FeedScore = ReferralLevelWeight + EngagementScore + CreditScore - TimeDecay

ReferralLevelWeight: F1 = 100, F2 = 50, F3 = 20

EngagementScore: actions in first 24h (views, likes, comments, shares)

CreditScore: decentralized ethical credit system

TimeDecay: decreasing weight over time

Balancing:

70‚Äì80% feed from referral chain

20‚Äì30% from outside exposure

High-credit posts can bypass referral order

Experimental boosted posts tested dynamically

üß© Roadmap

Leader dashboard

Phase 2 (Hybrid decentralized)
